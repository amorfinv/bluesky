This environment was generated with conda. However some packages were installed via pip.

In general the process for installing is to first follow the installation guidelines for BlueSky with conda:

After this, you can try the following

1. install ```geopandas``` with conda.
2. install ```osmnx``` with pip.
3. if you would like to also make some plots then install seaborn with pip.

The requirements are provided in the ```requirements.txt```. However, it is likely that it won't be possible to simply install them at once.
